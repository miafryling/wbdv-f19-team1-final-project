## Problem:
The problem we are trying to solve is helping connect animals that are up for adoption with people that are looking for pets.


## Types of users:
Admin: This is someone who manages the website and has admin privileges such as being able to edit/delete posts and update/edit users. 
Owner/Shelter: The owner or shelter is someone that posts pets up for adoption on our site. This can be an individual or a shelter that houses many animals. One goal of an owner/shelter is to post animals up for adoption. Another goal of theirs is to edit existing posts.  
Adopter: This is someone who uses the site to find an animal to adopt. One goal of the adopter is to make queries on the site searching for a specific type of animal. Another goal of the adopter is to browse animals based on general categories.

## Strategy
Our overall strategy is to use the Petfinder api to connect users with pets near them up for adoption. One thing we will collect from users is their location. The Petfinder api also includes location. This will be used to match users with animals near them. The Petfinder api is an api that allows the querying of a large database of pets up for adoption. This database comes from private users as well as shelters. It contains various types of animals with descriptions and data fields depending on the animal species.
